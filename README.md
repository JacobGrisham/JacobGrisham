# üëã Hi there
I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer in San Francisco. This is my personal GitHub account. My professional GitHub account is [JacobGrishamPowerSchool](https://github.com/JacobGrishamPowerSchool).

I primarily use this page to group my repos together, organize them within their group, and provide context for the group as a whole. I decided to manage the list of features and bugs for these projects in GitHub Issues for public visibility.

# üèÜ Project Showcase
High-quality, production-grade full-stack and front-end web applications polished with:
- Unit, integration, and automation tests
- Performance, security, accessibility, and SEO optimization
- Responsive, cross browser compatible CSS
- Automated code review
- Runtime optimized continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
- Deployment in a Docker container to a cloud server and delivered through a content delivery network (CDN)
- Google Analytics and Google Optimize
- And much more ...

Projects are organized from most recent to least.

# üõ† Specific Tools From Documentation Tutorials
Sometimes long-form courses don't cover specific web development technologies that I need to learn. This is especially true for relatively newer tools. Good news is that the documentation for most tools have a beginner's tutorial. Here is a collection organized from most recent to least.
- [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/JacobGrisham/elasticsearch)
- [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://github.com/JacobGrisham/aws-cdk)
- [GraphQL](https://github.com/JacobGrisham/graphql)

# üë©‚Äçüè´ Noteworthy Projects From Courses
Programs that focus on learning computer science concepts or web development technologies. Courses, and the projects within them, are organized from most recent to least. The naming convention for the repositories are based on what topic(s) I learned and/or what technologies I used.
